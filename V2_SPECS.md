# Authentication API (V2) JSON:API specification

> If youâ€™ve ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON:API can be your anti-bikeshedding tool.

> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application.

> Clients built around JSON:API are able to take advantage of its features around efficiently caching responses, sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.
